# Reflection Prompts

Use these prompts after completing milestones.

## After implementing the domain layer
- Which functions are easiest to test? Why?
- Where did you accidentally couple domain logic to UI concerns?

## After implementing the reducer
- Which actions were hardest to model?
- How did you decide what belongs in state vs derived selectors?

## After building the UI
- How did you ensure keyboard-only playability?
- What trade-offs did you make for mobile usability?

## Transfer
- How would you reuse this architecture for another grid-based puzzle (e.g., Kakuro, Nonogram)?
- What would you change if the app needed multiplayer or server persistence?
